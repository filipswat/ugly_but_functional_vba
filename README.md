# ugly_but_functional_vba
VBA code for various process efficiency/streamlining projects

This represents my journey from being absolutely clueless about VBA to consistently creating sloppy but functional code. Since I have little to no formal training, I'm certain there are many inefficiencies and areas for improvement. Any feedback is welcome.

Code has been taken from a bunch of personal/work projects (for work projects, any potentially sensitive information has been redacted or modified)
